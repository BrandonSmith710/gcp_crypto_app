# gcp_crypto_app
This repository contains a crypto currency price retrieval application which was programmed using the CoinMarketCap API and has been deployed to Google Cloud Platform. The application allows a user to enter the range of coin rankings to view, (ex. range of 2 - 15 would show the second most valuable coin, third, fourth, down to 15th).
